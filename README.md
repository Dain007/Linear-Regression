# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target or response variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or features). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, which means the relationship can be represented by a straight line.
The basic form of a linear regression model with one independent variable can be represented as:

y = mx + b

Where:

y is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).
x is the independent variable (the predictor or feature).
m is the slope of the line, representing the change in y for a unit change in x.
b is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when x is 0.
